# Project Progress Log

## Project Overview
[tldr-extension] - Chrome extension that intelligently summarizes articles with a single click using Groq's Llama 3.1 AI

## Current Status
COMPLETE

## Session History
### Session 1 - 2026-01-30
- Initialized project structure
- Implemented all 6 features end-to-end
- Built full extension with Vite

### Session 2 - 2026-01-31
- Ran build verification (Vite build successful)
- Ran E2E test suite (8/8 tests passing)
- Created private GitHub repo and pushed

## Completed Features
1. Article Extraction - Mozilla Readability.js integration with DOMPurify sanitization
2. Chrome AI Integration - Provider architecture ready (simplified to Groq-only for MVP)
3. Groq API Fallback - OpenAI-compatible API with clever prompting
4. Popup UI - 5 states (loading, success, not-article, error, no-provider)
5. Options Page - API key management, cache controls, status display
6. Summary Caching - URL-based hashing, 24hr expiry, LRU eviction (max 100 entries)

## In Progress
None - all features complete

## Known Issues
- Build warning: dynamic import in service-worker.js (non-blocking, optimization hint)
- 2 moderate npm audit vulnerabilities (in dev dependencies, not runtime)

## Technical Decisions
- **Groq-only for MVP**: Chrome AI (Gemini Nano) requires origin trial enrollment, simplified to Groq for immediate usability
- **Provider Factory Pattern**: Architecture ready to add Chrome AI, OpenAI, or other providers later
- **URL Hashing for Cache**: Using simplified hash function for cache keys to avoid crypto API complexity
- **24-hour Cache Expiry**: Balance between freshness and reducing API calls
- **LRU Eviction at 100 entries**: Keep storage footprint small while maintaining useful cache

## Next Steps
1. Publish to Chrome Web Store (optional)
2. Add Chrome AI provider when origin trial available
3. Consider adding export features (markdown, sharing)

## Environment Notes
- Node.js required for build
- Vite 5.4.x for bundling
- Playwright for E2E testing
- Chrome required for extension testing
